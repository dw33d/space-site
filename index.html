    <h1>The Big Bang</h1><br>
    <h2>This (practice static) page will briefly explain the Big Bang Theory </h2><br><br>
    <div class="topic">
        <p>About 13.8 Billion Years ago, the universe began as a tiny and dense ball of gas that spontaneously exploded. </p>
        <p>in the cosmos is expanding, faster than the speed of light as a result (called the <a href="https://www.space.com/25126-big-bang-theory.html"><i>Cosmic Inflation</i></a>).</p>
        <br>
        <img src="./imgs/bang.gif" class="img">
        <p>The inflation halted however and <i>Reheating</i> had occured just shortly...then followed by <i>Cooling</i>.</p>
        <p>During that period, the free floating nuclei and protons bonded together via fusion to form atoms.</p>
        <p>It had then taken 100s of millions of years for stars to form, lighting up the darkness</p><br>
    </div>
    <h2>This segues perfectly into the formation of our Solar-System.</h2>
    <div class="topic">
        <p>During the formation of stars...roughly 4.5 Billion years ago, a cloud of interstellar gas</p>
        <p> and dust collected and collapsed due to aperhaps nearby supernova shockwave.</p>

        <img src="./imgs/dust.jpeg" class="img">
        <p>The gravity pulled the hydrogen so cose they formed heloum and released a lot of energy.</p>
        <p>This is how our Sun was fomed. Matter arounf clumped at violent speeds...forming our planets</p>
        <p>And Voil√†...we have ourselves a functioning and beautiful <a href="./model.html">Solar-System (Click to see)</a>...all because of a spontaneous explosion!</p>
