A site that briefly explains the big-bang and shows a pseudo-3D model of the solar system
Planets do not orbit in a circle or even partcularly predictable manner, sort of elipsical and sporadic

"

Planets do not move in fixed orbits, they move in very finely balanced stable orbits.

What you see in the sky today is the result of 4 billion years of thumping, bumping, gravitational games and a lot of stuff falling into the Sun. It's all a very delicate balance of velocity, vector and gravity and it's not all that difficult to upset. While Jupiter won't be leaving the system for anything less than another stellar mass, if you pass a Mars-sized object past our planet it will disturb the orbit enough that our current environmental concerns will quickly become irrelevant.

And don't forget that we have only been studying the solar system for a very, very tiny part of it's existence. We missed all the fun stuff early on.
